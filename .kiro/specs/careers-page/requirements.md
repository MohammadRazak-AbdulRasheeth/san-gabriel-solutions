# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Careers section will focus on recruiting commission-based sales partners through two distinct sales paths: Inventory Acquisition (supply-side) and Advertising Sales (demand-side). The section must clearly communicate the commission-based compensation model, role distinctions, and application process while maintaining an entrepreneurial tone that attracts self-driven, revenue-focused partners.
